# Optimal Poker Project

Fully functioning individual data project looking at distributions of player strategies! Check out the full website at https://optimal-poker-habits.streamlit.app/

### Data Collection:
Data mined 10 million+ poker hand histories from IRC dataset to analyze idiosyncratic strategies in multi-agent asymmetric poker

### Modelling: 
Feature selected robust variables to model behavior by reducing dimensions of player actions into axes of tightness and aggressiveness
Clustered player strategies through K-means and Gaussian Mixture models to predict playersâ€™ systematically exploitable strategies
