## Disclaimer
This project is purely for my personal enjoyment, but I do especially have to thank Allen Wang 
for his immense help in unwrapping the datamined files. I would also like to thank Jax Ma for his 
personal and computational support. Last of all, I would like to thank the University of Chicago, 
who provided me with the knowledge and computational resources that I could not have done without.
